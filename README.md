# Hospital-Management-System-Using-C-
A Hospital Management System (HMS) is a software application designed to manage various aspects of a hospital's operations, including patient information, doctor schedules, medical records, billing, pharmacy management, and more. Implementing such a system using C++ involves structuring the program to handle these functionalities efficiently.

# Step to Run this project
# 1 Open Visual Studio Code: Launch Visual Studio Code on your system.

# 2 Add C++ Source Code File: Place your C++ source code file (let's say hospital_management.cpp) in a folder on your system.

# 3 Compile the Source Code: You need to compile your C++ source code into an executable file. This typically involves using a C++ compiler like g++ or clang++ to convert the human-readable source code into machine-executable binary code. This step may require configuring build settings, including any necessary compiler flags and dependencies.

# 4 This command compiles your source code (hospital_management.cpp) and generates an executable file named hospital_management.exe.
  # g++ -o Hospital.exe Hospital.cpp


# 4 Open Terminal in VS Code: Inside Visual Studio Code, open the integrated terminal.

# 5 Navigate to the Folder: Use the terminal to navigate to the folder where your source code and compiled executable are located.
cd path/to/your/folder

# 6 Run the Executable: Execute the compiled executable file.

.\Hospital.exe

This command runs the compiled executable file hospital_management.exe.

Thank You !!!!
